This is a simple and efficient To-Do list application built using PHP, designed to help users manage tasks in a straightforward way.
The app allows users to:
Add tasks: Quickly add new tasks to the list.
Mark tasks as completed: Check off tasks when they're done.
Delete tasks: Remove tasks from the list once they are no longer needed.
Persistent data storage: Tasks are stored in a database (using MySQL) and persist even after page reloads.
